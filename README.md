# `hihello-assignment`

My solution for HiHello's mobile engineering coding assignment: a simple calculator.

> Build a simple four function (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) calculator.
>
> Your application should be written with Expo and TypeScript. It must provide a GUI and work like a standard calculator.
>
> Note that you are not required to implement the memory functions (M+/MR/MC).

## 🏃‍♂️ Getting Started

### 🚧 Setup

Install the project's dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

### 🚥 Running

-   Run Expo Go on iOS:

    ```bash
    npm run ios
    ```

-   Run Expo Go on Web:

    ```bash
    npm run web
    ```

    The page will reload if you make edits.
    You will also see any errors in the browser's console.

## 🛠️ Development

### 🔍 Validation

-   Validate the project with TSC:

    ```bash
    npm run ts:check
    ```

-   Validate the project with ESLint and Prettier:

    ```bash
    npm run lint
    ```

    Alternatively, you can potentially auto-fix any outstanding issues with `npm run lint:fix`.
